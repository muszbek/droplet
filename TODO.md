- adapt OATH2 for new auth logic - later, not priority
- mock OAUTH2
- unit test for oauth2


- initMap not loading fast enough error (not a function) on javascript

- store form javascript when edit address create a marker on original address

- location data is needed in publish offer and show self offers
- create offer endpoint
- list offers endpoint

- price in create offer should be adapted to be numeric, with correct unit / currency

- location is stored in postgres so it can be queried
- how do I push new logs into a liveview? - phoenix channels, no liveview but js directly
- channels - each store is a different topic, kafka consumer re-routes
- kafka is not the right tool, forget real time responsiveness, offers are postgres database elements
